This project involves designing a machine learning model using two classic algorithms: decision tree and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The goal is to predict the musical genre of a track based on specific features extracted from the data. The model was developed from scratch, with a focus on understanding the underlying principles of classification algorithms. This project serves as an excellent starting point for exploring machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems, such as musical genre classification.
