# Music Genre Classification from Scratch

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a machine learning model entirely **from scratch** using two classic algorithms: **Decision Tree** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. The goal is to **predict the musical genre of a track** based on specific features extracted from the dataset.

All aspects of the project, including the algorithms, evaluation metrics, and prediction logic, were implemented manually without using machine learning libraries. This approach helps in **understanding the core principles of classification algorithms** and their application to real-world problems.

## Features
- Implemented **Decision Tree** and **KNN** algorithms from scratch.
- Developed **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics** manually.
- Trained and tested the model using real dataset features.
- Explored the behavior of algorithms with different parameters.

## Technologies
- **Python** (pure implementation, no external ML libraries)
